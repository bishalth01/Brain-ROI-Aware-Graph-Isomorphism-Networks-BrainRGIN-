# Brain-ROI-Aware-Graph-Isomorphism-Networks-BrainRGIN-
Extending from the existing graph convolution networks, our approach incorporates a clustering-based embedding and graph isomorphism network method in the graph convolutional layer to reflect nature of the brain sub-network organization and efficient expression, in combination with TopK pooling and attention-based readout functions.
